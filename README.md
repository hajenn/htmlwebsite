#HTML and CSS

This was a terrible try to remake my figma prototype. I spendt to much time figuring the design rather than coding the site

Issues:

.to many divs, needs to be deleted
.the DRY principle is not really followed
.bugs with the text
.to big elements
.not responsive


I want to redo this site and i have to practice more with flexbox and grid
